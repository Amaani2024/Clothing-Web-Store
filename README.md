            System Workflow of the Cloth Web Store Application

 When a user opens the website, they are first directed to the Home Page,
 which displays all product categories in a clean and user-friendly layout.
 By selecting a category, the user can view all related products with basic
 details such as images, prices, and short descriptions.

 The user can click on a product to view detailed information, including
 full description, price, and available stock. After selecting the required
 quantity, the product can be added to the Cart. The Cart Page allows users
 to view selected items, update quantities, remove products, and see the
 total price.

 Once satisfied, the user proceeds to the Checkout Page, where the order 
 summary is displayed. The user selects the delivery option and completes the
 purchase using Cash on Delivery (COD). After confirming the checkout, 
 the system processes the order, updates stock details, and sends an order 
 confirmation. Users can later track their order status and provide reviews 
 after delivery.
